# 👀 Hey there! I'm Aayush. 

I am a Software Engineer at LinkedIn working on Distributed Systems, Operating System Compliance and Machine Learning.  

### 💡 What I'm interested in

I am really passionate about how things work at scale, and I try my best to fiddle around with some code to aid that. I have worked extensively with Computer Vision in the past and I hold that interest dearly as well.

### 👨🏽‍🎓Here's what I'm currently learning:

- Ember.js, I don't know for the love of god why
- Golang
